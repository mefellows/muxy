  ## HTTP Proxy: Configures an HTTP Proxy
  - name: http_proxy
    config:
      host: 0.0.0.0
      port: 80
      protocol: http
      proxy_host: backend
      proxy_port: 80
      proxy_protocol: http

## Middleware
##
## Middleware are plugins that are given the opportunity to intervene
## before a request is dispatched to the proxied system (PRE_DISPATCH event)
## and afterwards (POST_DISPATCH event). They are given a reference to
## the current context (HTTP Context or []bytes) and can mutate them.
##
## Middleware are executed in the order specified in this config.

middleware:

  ## Request Logger - use this to see what's going in/out of the Proxy.
